 <p10>I made a cupcake shop called Sweets Cupcakery. The location I envision for it is
  Southern California so in the logos I added the words SoCal Cupcake Parlor below Sweets
  Cupcakery. I made the S and C in Sweets Cupcakery a different color than the rest of the letters
  and the S and the C in SoCal a different color than the rest to symbolize that the S and C is for
  SoCal. I wanted the color palette to be white, pink, and green. I looked on pinterest for pictures
  that are those colors and have the vibe I wanted the cupcake shop to have. I used photos of The
  Beverly Hills Hotel, the beach, cupcakes, and some other things that I felt resonated with Sweets
  Cupcakery. For the thumbnail, I used five pictures that I thought symbolize the brand the most. I
  made two logos - a circular logo, and a rectangular one. I included a cupcake graphic, and the
  name of the company in the circular logo. For the rectangle logo, I included the name of the
  company and I matched the sprinkles on the cupcake to the sprinkles in the rectangle logo.</p10>

  <p9>Artist statement:</p9>
  <br>
  <p14>I created two memes. My first meme displays a dog with sunglasses on, eating popcorn and watching a movie. I then wrote on the image, "when it's finally time to relax and watch tv". My second meme displays a man riding a bike, looking very joyful and I wrote, "when its last period on friday". I chose these two memes because I found that they were both funny and many people could relate to them.</p14>

   <p6>Reflection of digital media</p6>
 <p19>I have enjoyed digital media this year. I found most of the projects to be fun and I have learned lots on the functions of digital art apps.</p19>
